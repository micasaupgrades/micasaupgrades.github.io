<div class="about container"> <h2 class="page-header">Our Story</h2> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-6"> <p>Today’s digitally savvy consumer expects to be able to get inspired, discover, share and shop online - anyplace and anytime.</p> <p>Homes are where dreams are built and memories are made. We should know more about our home buyers and help them tell their story.</p> <p>Home builders should easily be able to manage and sell their home options online across devices, do personalize marketing, measure effectiveness and make data driven decisions.</p> <p>We believe there's more to offer than high pressure sales meetings and a catalog of products; there has to be a better way. That's how we got started.</p> <p>At our foundation, MiCasa challenges the status quo of designing a home: <ul> <li>We believe in inspiration, collaboration and the sharing of knowledge</li> <li>Great design and easy to use technology is always within reach</li> <li>Everyone deserves the home of their dreams to enjoy their greatest moments</li> </ul> </p> <p>With these core beliefs in mind we set out to: <ul> <li>Let builders easily and quickly create their own online upgrade marketplace without needing all the technical know how and without breaking the bank</li> <li>Make the new home upgrade experience enjoyable for all involved</li> </ul> </p> <p>Continuous shopping. Smart marketing. Increased sales. It is all possible.</p> <p>That’s MiCasa.</p> </div> <div class="col-md-6"> <img class="img-responsive" src="images/about.45accdd1.jpg" alt=""> </div> </div> <!-- /.row --> <!-- Team Members --> <div class="row"> <div class="col-lg-12"> <h2 class="page-header">Our Team</h2> </div> <div class="col-md-6"> <div class="thumbnail"> <div class="row"> <div class="caption"> <h3>Matt Livingston<br> <small>Co-founder</small> </h3> <ul class="list-inline">  <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/matthew-livingston/99/718/965"><i class="fa fa-2x fa-linkedin-square"></i></a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="bio text-left"> <p>Matt has over 15 years of real estate experience, beginning his homebuilding career at Centex Homes.</p> <p>Since then, Matt founded Ridge Crest Real Estate, LLC a residential development company and RC Homes, Inc., a Southern California homebuilding company.
